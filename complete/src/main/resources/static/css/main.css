ywhere beneath src/main/resources/static is an appropriate place for static content such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. The static directory is served from /. For example, src/main/resources/static/signin.css will be served from /signin.css whereas src/main/resources/static/css/signin.css will be served from /css/signin.css.

The src/main/resources/templates folder is intended for view templates that will be turned into HTML by a templating engine such as Thymeleaf, Freemarker, or Velocity, etc. You shouldn't place static content in this directory.

Also make sure you haven't used @EnableWebMvc in your application as that will disable Spring Boot's auto-configuration of Spring MVC.
