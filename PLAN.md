Create new kbspring project on github that starts with gs-validating-form-input and kb-prototype

NOTE!
From gs-validating-form-input you need to take just the complete directory.
Make the contents of complete the new top level directory of the new kbspring project

Copy the contents of kb-prototype into kbspring/src/main/resources/templates/kb.
Be sure to not copy the .git folder from kb-prototype.
Add a @GetMapping method to WebController.java that serves /kb like we reviewed together on Saturday.
